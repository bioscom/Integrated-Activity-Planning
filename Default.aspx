                        Change control is a formal process used to ensure that changes to a 
                        product or system are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner. It 
                        reduces the possibility that unnecessary changes will be introduced to a system 
                        without forethought, introducing faults into the system or undoing changes made 
                        by other users of software. The goals of a change control procedure usually 
                        include minimal disruption to services, reduction in back-out activities, and 
                        cost-effective utilization of resources involved in implementing change.

                        It is the policy of SPDC to manage changes to planned activities in a controlled 
                        manner using the change control procedure. The objectives of change control are 
                        to apply a level of review, challenge and approval appropriate to the nature of 
                        the change. This will ensure that changes are not made to the agreed plan in an 
                        uncontrolled or unauthorised way that compromises safe and efficient operations.

                    <p>
                        A change is identified first as a proposal and the impact of the 
                        change is fully assessed and evaluated before any action is taken. The change is 
                        submitted as a fully evaluated proposal to the appropriate level of authority 
                        for approval and communication to all affected parties in a timely manner.
                    </p>

                        This system documents the process that is to be used for requesting and 
                        managing changes to plans created or maintained by the project owners and 
                        executors. This process will facilitate communication about requested changes 
                        among the stakeholders of the project, provide a common process for resolving 
                        requested changes and reported problems, and reduce the uncertainty around the 
                        existence, state, and outcome of a change that has been requested in a project.
